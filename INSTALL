Building Tessa requires cmake


    mkdir build
    cmake ..
    make

Currently there is some redundancy with the autogen/configure stages and the cmake setup phase

Always verify the signatures and checksums.

See doc/build-*.md for instructions on building tessad, the intended-for-services, no-graphical-interface,
reference implementation of Tessa.
